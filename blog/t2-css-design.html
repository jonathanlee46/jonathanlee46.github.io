    <h1>Of Margins, Borders, and Padding</h1>
    <h4>March 20, 2015</h4>

       Learning about margins, borders, and padding in CSS can be a headache.  Fortunately, images like the ones below are here to help us understand the exact relationship all 3 have with each other.  

       The most important piece of this sandwich, in my humble opinion, is the 'border'.  The border, sitting between the margin and the padding, defines the relative size of the space you want to work with.  Or, more specifically, how big you want your object to be.  

       Next, we can define how far away from other objects we want ours to be by manipulating the margins.  This tool is good because we can manipulate where we want our objects to be in relevance to other things, such as the limits of the web page, the web browser, or other objects on the page.  

       Finally, the padding can define how compacted we want our content to be inside of our object.  For instance, if we want to have a graphical border around a block of text, we can use the padding to help frame our text in a more uniform fashion.  

       CSS is a wonderful tool to style our webpages the way we want to, and these are just some of the ways we can use to stylise our pages more effectively and efficiently.
