    <h1>Of Stereotypes and Threat</h1>
    <h4>April 4, 2015</h4>

        Stereotype Threat is a really interesting look into the human psyche, coined by Steele & Aronson in 1995.  They found that African American males in college performed more poorly than their White counterparts when their races were emphasized, while they performed equally or better without any emphasis.  While I'm not very skilled in examining social behavior myself, I have definitely seen this idea in the real world.

        I have definitely experienced this and have seen it myself.  One's racial background is made a pretty big deal of when applying to universities from highschool.  While touring all of the UC's and other public universities, I kept hearing over and over again how the percentage of Asian students at the university was 40%.  It was clear that the number of Asian students the public universities could accept was capped, and that being Asian on its own would put me into a highly competitive field.  This alone affected my psyche and attitude going into the applications process, and I believe the effect was negative.  Stereotype Threat is very real and is everywhere.
