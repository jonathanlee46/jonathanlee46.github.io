  <h1>Of versions and changes</h1>

        The concept of version control is a daunting one at best.  When we sit down to code everyday, we seek to add changes to our pre-existing code and thereby improve what we've written before or add new functions and features to what we have.  This is why it is important for us to keep extremely detailed records of what we did, where in the code we did it, when we did it, and why.  Additionally, if keeping track of these changes for one person's daily work is already a tall order, doing so for a group of people or a whole company full of people is much more complicated and exponentially harder.  "Version Control" is the practice of trying to streamline this process and make everything more efficient and easier to organize for all of us.

        In order to help us keep track of our changes, we have Git.  Git is a program that resides inside of our local repositories.  So long as they are connected to the original ones on GitHub, Git is constantly watching to see if we make changes to the files in our directories, if we create new directories, and if we create new files in them.  Thanks to this, after we've made our multitude of changes, we can easily commit this change to our repository, push the changes to GitHub, and this can (if specified) become a new version.  Thus, if in the future we need to backtrack our changes to regain stability or to undo mistakes in the code, the versions of our repositories are nicely kept and organized for us - all thanks to Git!

        Finally, we store our code on GitHub.  Why do we do this?  In the current age of ubiquitous internet and multiple devices per capita, it would be silly if we had to manually copy and update every single change we make to our code on each one of our devices, whether it be the home PC, a work PC, or the laptops, phones, and tablets that go in between.  A cloud-based solution for us to access our code anywhere we please is by far and away a much easier way to do so.  Storing our code on GitHub is one such way to do this.  The added bonus (or perhaps, the main purpose) of GitHub is also that many people can access the online repositories at once.  It is also an extremely efficient way for groups of coders, whether they are coworkers or friends working on a hobby project, to synchronize and coordinate their efforts.  Git and GitHub both are a godsend for us coders to deal with version control!
