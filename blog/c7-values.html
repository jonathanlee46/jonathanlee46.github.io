        In my most happiest, proudest, and most satisfied times, many of these values come to mind.  Accomplishment, coolness under fire, personal development, accountability, effectiveness, challenge, and courage are the most important to me.  In general, I try to live up to these values at a level of at least 4 (on a scale of 5).  To me, personal development is what I live for.  In my opinion, everything in life can be seen as an opportunity for personal development - from simple things as conversing with friends or strangers, to lifelong pursuits such as sports, hobbies, and professions.  In my personal life, I pursue physical, mental, and social activities not just for my own enjoyment, but also as a way to continually improve upon and develop who I am as a person.

        For example, when I was much younger, I always had a short temper and a bad mood; I was hard to get along with and harder not to make angry.  However, through years of the study and practice of Tai Chi, I have been able to learn how to fundamentally shift how I think and feel about situations instead of respond with anger or frustration.  I have learned so much about patience and inner peace from my dedication to finding calm and peace from this activity.  This has helped me become a much more serene and gentle person both inside and out over time, and has affected not only my social life, but all aspects of mind, body, and social interaction.

        Recently I was able to help give advice to a younger friend of mine that is discouraged with his progress in high school.  This was heavily related with my value of personal development.  My friend had become discouraged with their education because of the huge pressures put upon them by the modern high school to college/university transition.  Not only is everything made such a huge deal out of, but universities are demanding ever more competitive students, and parents are also increasingly anxious about every observable aspect of their children.  In this system, my friend had lost their motivation to respond to such immense pressures.  I was able to help them see a different side of the coin, where instead of trying to meet demands and goals set by invisible forces, to look at education more of a way to develop and expand one's knowledge of the world around them, and to be able to further their knowledge with the far greater resources that universities supply.

        When I feel down and out, and not just when I'll be at DBC, my personal values will help serve to assuage my fears and anxiety.  I feel that my search for personal development includes values such as spirituality, tranquility, movement and willpower.  These values are all practiced and reflected upon by those who practice martial arts, and my experience in Tai Chi has always helped me strengthen these core values.  These, combined with some quality sleep time and some physical movement almost always serve to get me back on my feet.
