    <h1>Of Strife and Conflict</h1>
    <h4>April 19th, 2015</h4>

        I had pretty major conflict with my parents when I told them about my university plans and about what I wanted to study.  There was a lot of arguing and friction between their ideals and desires about my education, and what I myself wanted to study and learn.  At first, there were a lot of emotions from both sides.  For me, it was anger and frustration as to why they didn't understand my own desires as to what I wanted to study, and where I wanted to go in life.

        I realized many things when I started to step back and objectively analyze the situation.  Because of my parents' relatively sheltered upbringing, they did not understand the lifestyles and work lives of those who studied the field I wanted to study in.  I discovered that the reason they were so against my ideas is because of their fear of this unknown and how my life would turn out.  The solution, then, was to teach them about all of these things.

        In order to resolve this conflict, I helped my parents learn more about the university I wanted to attend.  I showed them examples of what the kind of classes I wanted to take were like, the people that studied these subjects, and the types of jobs and fields of work that they eventually went on to do.  This helped to assuage their fears and eventually they not only agreed to my decisions, but even supported me more than I ever thought they would!

        I learned from this experience that transparency, honesty, and most of all good communication is an amazing tool to solve many conflicts and problems people will have.  Turning to anger or arguments closes other parties off and makes them less willing to listen and reason with you.  Communication is key!
