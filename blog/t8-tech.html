    <h1>Of Repitition and Recursion</h1>

        Repitition is something we often depend upon computers to help us carry out.  Since we as humans can only (for the most part) carry out our tasks one at a time, it becomes an extremely tedious task to have to go through massive documents or databases and change one value at a time.  To make things easier and more time-efficient, we use methods, functions, and all sorts of loops and other iterations to process all the information we need processed.  Let's take a look at one such way programmers use to solve these repetitive tasks: Recursion.

      <p>
        Recursion is a method of coding where in order to complete a bigger task, we have to repeat the same task over and over multiple times.  In my own amateur terms, recursion is used by calling a method within itself in order to carry out the same task on a smaller, processed subset of the data that method has produced.  In other words, a method that can call itself as many times as it needs to complete the task it sets out to accomplish.

      <p>
        There is immense power in this idea.  In applicable situations, the idea is that with one small block of finite code, one could carry out a task an infinite number of times in order to complete what one sets out to do.  This is even if there is actual no repitition in the code itself, ie any repitition required could in some instances be handled by Recursion and thus be amazingly efficient!
