        Learning how to ask the right questions is always an extremely difficult task.  It's always difficult to communicate and convey what you're thinking in your own mind to other people - it's even harder to do so in order to try and receive information in return.  To this end, just like with function arguments, we need to ask of people the right kind of information and in a way they'll understand an accept the question.

        I ask many questions, and in general I've learned that one must set the questions up to be answered.  Questions that seem very hard to answer will often go ignored.  Simply asking a vague question such as "What do I do with my life?" will not yield very productive answers.  In order to shore down our questions to be more answerable, we need to be more specific.  "What do I do with my life now that I am a billionaire and I really like to party?" will help those you ask summon mental images of your situation and context, and will also help them come up with better and more specific suggestions.  Let's all try to make our questions more answerable by being more specific about what we're asking!
