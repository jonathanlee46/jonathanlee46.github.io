    <h1>Of Instances and Variables</h1>
    <h4>March 25, 2015</h4>

    <section>
      <p>
        Let's talk about instance variables.  These variables are one that span the entire existence of a class, and no more.  Thus, if you were to create an instance variable, any methods or any code within that class could access this variable.  Anything outside of the class, such as methods of other classes,would not be able to access it.  We mark these variables by using the '@' symbol before it.  Just like @this !
      </p>
      <p>
        Take for example, class wo.  I've initialized it with the string @variable.  Because I've done so by first using an @ symbol, it can now be accessed anywhere within the wo class.  One such place that it can be accessed are from other methods within the wo class.  I've created a method called print, which will simply print the instanced variable!  However, any methods outside of the wo class, such as the method pan, will not be able to access @variable, and it will throw errors.

        class wo
          def initialize
            @variable = "poi"
          end

          def print
            p @variable
          end
        end

        def pan
          p @variable
        end
