    <h1>Of Thinking and Learning</h1>
  <h4>March 13, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
        There are as many ways of looking at something and thinking about it as there are people on Earth.  This makes it so when people have to work together, pairs and teammates have to communicate in such a way that facilitates a more effective way of sharing their thoughts and trading ideas.  Understanding different types of thought is a big first step to understanding how you work as an individual, and how you can work with others.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe I think in a concrete and sequential manner.  I think very logically, and I like order, predictability, and following instructions.  This is a major part of the reason why I decided to learn how to code from a coding bootcamp - I like the organization of the classroom environment, and the stability of working under one set of teachers and from the same program (as opposed to many different teachers with different ideas of how an undergraduate program should be run).  Since I thrive in a more logical, organized and instructional environment, I expect I'll be able to work efficiently at DBC.

        Because of my thinking style, I find that working with totally abstract ideas, or questions with no right or wrong answers especially challenging.  So far, lots of our DBC workload has been to reflect upon things or write blogs such as this one, and this has been, in my own experience, the hardest part of DBC thus far.  Dealing with these ideas has really helped me grow as a person, and thinker, and now as a coder.

        The growth vs. fixed mindset idea is one everyone must contemplate if they wish to learn and expand their minds.  I, for one, have an awful time with anything to do with imagination, group work, and abstract thinker's questions without proper answers.  However, being forced to use all of these in DBC has so far really expanded my mindset going into all of these weekly challenges and has slowly but surely made me a more well-rounded thinker, bit by bit.  I feel that I must continue to expand my thinking style like this in order to succeed as a world-class coder.
