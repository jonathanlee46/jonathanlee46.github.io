    <h1>Of Technology and Diversity</h1>
    <h4>March 21, 2015</h4>

        Recent studies have shown that for everything Silicon Valley is amazing at, diversity is not one of its strong suits.  California's Bay Area, host to Silicon Valley, has an extremely diverse demographic.  She is 52% White including Hispanic, 7% African American, 23% Asian, and a mix of many more types of peoples.  In contrast to this, Google released the internal numbers of their employee's demographics last year, and have shown that not only is the workforce 70% men, over 60% is White, 30% Asian, 3% Hispanic, and 2% Black.

        Web and smart device technology is becoming an entirely global and universal phenomenon.  It stands to reason that those of us who use the devices should also be the ones developing for them.  So that all cultures can be better served and represented for while using today's technology, Silicon Valley should focus on also increasing her diversity.  Many steps can be taken to improve these numbers, but most of them stem from education.  It is very reassuring to see that there are many programs that cater specifically to women, and that many schools are beginning to teach computer science to try and rectify this problem.  Let's all work towards a more diverse tech world!
