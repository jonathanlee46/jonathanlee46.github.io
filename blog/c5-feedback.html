    <h1>Of Pairing and Feedback</h1>
    <h4>March 28, 2015</h4>

        Pairing up these last 5 weeks has really been a blast.  I'll admit that at first, I was apprehensive about upcoming sessions and generally not looking forward to them.  However, DBC has given us much-needed structures and ideas to follow, such as discussing how we like to do things, how we think about things, and also about the navigator-driver pairing style.  This has really raised the level of effectiveness of the pairing sessions, and after the first couple weeks I've found that I really look forward to my pairing sessions every week.  It's amazing to have someone else working to solve the same challenge together and both try to come up with solutions to try and implement.  The moment we both light up when the program finally runs, or runs correctly, is easily the most rewarding part of working together.

        In order to further improve our pairing sessions, we have been working hard at giving each other feedback for every session we work with people.  The feedback I have been receiving has been kind, affectionate, and most importantly specific about my strengths and weaknesses.  This helps me continue to build and develop my own teamwork skills in an inspiring and positive environment.  Based on the feedback I've received, I figured out that the way I was trying to share code with people wasn't very effective.  I was using a shared google doc to collaborate on code, which actually added its own fancy formatting (such as smart quotes) that ruined the code.  I have since fixed this by finding coderpad.io, which works far more effectively.  Inversely from reading the feedback I've received, writing good feedback for other people has been very tough.  It was tough to try and be affenctionable and provide criticism at the same time.  I'll try my best to improve this area as we go along!
