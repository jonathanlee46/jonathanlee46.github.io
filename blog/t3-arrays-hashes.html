    <h1>Of Arrays and Hashes</h1>
  <h4>March 12, 2015</h4>

      Data structures are extremely important for programming.  This is because the vast amounts of data and variables we need to store in increasingly complicated programs is extremely hard to organize and keep track of.  In order to more effectively organize the data we must work with, we can put them into data structures like arrays and hashes.  This allows us to easily manipulate the data in each separate structure in different ways, or pick and choose different items within to use.  Let's take a look at what each of these structures are.

        An array is a simple, ordered, collection of objects.  The collection is organized by a simple integer index.  We can thus store any sort of variable or string in the indexed slots, and we can call upon them or manipulate them as we wish.  In the exercises we did this week, for example, we found the sum of all the numbers contained in example arrays, and we concatenated arrays of words into single strings.  Being able to work with entire arrays of data at a time makes for much more efficient coding.

        A hash is similar to an array, except that it does not use a an integer-based index.  It simply has a key -> value system, where the key can be anything and the value can be anything.  This seems like it will eventually have much more efficient uses, such as if we don't require an integer index to store the data we want to use.
