        Objects in JavaScript are a container or a structure of "properties".  It's essentially a very simple dictionary wherein properties are defined within the container.

        Ruby objects, rather than containing a "collection" of different properties, contains a hash of the different properties.

      <p>
        These two structures in JavaScript and Ruby are quite similar, but because of that subtle difference, there is a fundamental difference in how variables or "properties" within these objects can be accessed.  As JavaScript uses a collection of properties within a simple container, there is no actual data encapsulation on the objects.  Objects in JavaScript can be created by constructor functions, which leads to the ability to prototypically inherit properties from their mother objects.

        Ruby's properties are tightly contained within their hash tables, such that in order to manipulate the instance variables contained within, one must (in most cases) call upon the method or object itself in order to access the variables.  The objects are also very closely tied with the classes that create them.
