    <h1>Of Kitchens and Tables</h1>
    <h4>March 1, 2015</h4>

        Coming into DBC, I didn't really know what to expect.  As per Shereef's amazing analogy in the Fireside Chat, I paid the money and had fully expected this school to be that restaurant table experience.  In fact, before he brought up that analogy, I realized that I had been living most of my life trained to think this way.  Listening to his Fireside Chat philosophy on Kitchen vs Table, as well as other DBC video's I've seen so far (such as on Emotional Intelligence) has really begun to open my eyes to what DBC really is.

        With this video in mind, my expectations of DBC have totally changed.  I thought before that I would just show up, put in my hours and toil away at the camp for as long as it took to complete my work, take my education, get out and get a job.  But now I am definitely a whole lot more excited to get together with people and really try and create something.  Put on the chef's hat and really try to make a dish, so to speak.  The whole point of why I wanted to get into development was to create something with my own two hands, and do it together with those around me.  Why not start now?
