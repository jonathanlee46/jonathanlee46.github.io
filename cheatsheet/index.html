					<h1>Ruby Arrays</h1>

					<!-- Paragraphs -->
					<h3>Creating Arrays</h3>
					<p>
						A new array can be created by using the literal constructor []. Arrays can contain different types of objects.  An array can also be created by explicitly calling ::new with zero, one (the initial size of the Array) or two arguments (the initial size and a default object).  To create an array with separate objects a block can be passed instead.  An array can also be created by using the Array() method, provided by Kernel, which tries to call to_ary, then to_a on its argument.
					</p>

					<h3>Accessing Elements</h3>
					<p>
						Elements in an array can be retrieved using the #[] method. It can take a single integer argument (a numeric index), a pair of arguments (start and length) or a range. Negative indices start counting from the end, with -1 being the last element.  The slice method works in an identical manner to #[]. To raise an error for indices outside of the array bounds or else to provide a default value when that happens, you can use fetch.  The special methods first and last will return the first and last elements of an array, respectively.  
					</p>

					<h3>Adding Items to Arrays</h3>
					<p>
						Items can be added to the end of an array by using either push or <<.  Unshift will add a new item to the beginning of an array.  With insert you can add a new element to an array at any position.  Using the insert method, you can also insert multiple values at once.
					</p>

					<h1>Ruby Hashes</h1>

					<h3>What are hashes?</h3>
					<p>
						A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.  Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.
					</p>

					<h3>Common Uses</h3>
					<p>
						Hashes are an easy way to represent data structures.  Hashes are also commonly used as a way to have named parameters in functions. Note that no brackets are used below. If a hash is the last argument on a method call, no braces are needed, thus creating a really clean interface.  
					</p>

					<h3>Hash Keys</h3>
					<p>
						Two objects refer to the same hash key when their hash value is identical and the two objects are eql? to each other.  A user-defined class may be used as a hash key if the hash and eql? methods are overridden to provide meaningful behavior. By default, separate instances refer to separate hash keys.  A typical implementation of hash is based on the objectâ€™s data while eql? is usually aliased to the overridden == method.
